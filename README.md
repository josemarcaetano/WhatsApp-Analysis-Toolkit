# WhatsApp-Analysis-Toolkit

Code from our WebSci 2019 paper. 
In the paper, we characterize and analyze how attention propagates among the participants of a WhatsApp group. 
An attention cascade begins when a user asserts a topic in a message to the group, which could include written text, 
photos, or links to articles online. Others then propagate the information by responding to it.
For details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00825).
